### Get it
```
PM> Install-Package PrimaryConstructor
```

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio version 16.8 and above is required as its first version to support source generators.

### Usage

Declare class with `partial`, and annotate with `[PrimaryConstructor]`.
And then you can declare your dependencies with readonly fields.

```csharp
[PrimaryConstructor]
public partial class MyService
{
    private readonly MyDependency _myDependency;

    ...
}
```

When compile, following source will be injected.

```csharp
partial class MyService
{
    public MyService(MyDependency myDependency)
    {
        this._myDependency = myDependency;
    }
}
```
